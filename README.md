# Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi

An Implementation of Clean Architecture with ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi. With this Open-Source BoilerPlate Template, you will get access to the world of Loosely-Coupled and Inverted-Dependency Architecture in ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi with a lot of best practices.

Check out the [Project Page](https://www.codewithmukesh.com/project/clean-architecture-with-aspnet-core-webapi/) to learn more about this Open Source Project.

## Releases

v1.0-preview - [Download the first Preview here](https://github.com/iammukeshm/CleanArchitecture.WebApi/releases/tag/v1.0-preview) 

### v1 Preview.
Follow these steps to get started with this Boiler Plate Template.
1. Clone this Repository and Extract it to a Folder.
3. Change the Connection Strings for the Application and Identity in the WebApi/appsettings.json - (WebApi Project)
2. Run the following commands on Powershell in the WebApi Projecct's Directory.

## Purpose of this Project

Does it really make sense to Setup your ASP.NET Core Solution everytime you start a new WebApi Project ? Aren't we wasting quite a lot of time in doing this over and over gain?

This is the exact Problem that I intend to solve with this Full-Fledged ASP.NET Core 3.1 WebApi Solution Template, that also follows various principles of Clean Architecture.

The primary goal is to create a Full-Fledged implementation, that is well documented along with the steps taken to build this Solution from Scratch. This Solution Template will also be available within Visual Studio 2019 (by installing the required Nuget Package / Extension).
- Demonstrate Clean Monolith Architecture in ASP.NET Core 3.1 
- This is not a Proof of Concept
- Implementation that is ready for Production
- Integrate the most essential libraries and packages

## Share it!
I have personally not come across a clean implementation on a WebAPI, which is the reason that I started building this up. There are quite a lot of improvements and fixes along the way from the day I started out. Thanks to the community for the support and suggestions.
Please share this Repository within your developer community, if you think that this would a difference! Thanks.
